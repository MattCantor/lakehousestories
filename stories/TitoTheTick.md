# Tito the Tick

Tito the Tick lives in the woods around the lakehouse.
He sees something golden-brown and climbs onto it.
He continues climbing, toward a bright light. Tito feels two fingers grabbing him, and pulling.
And he can't hold on. Then Tito feels a flushing, and he goes down the drain! He's in a toilet!

Tito spends a few weeks inside the plumbing of the lakehouse, slowly making his way through the septic system, until finally he's released beneath the front yard.
It's been many weeks, but he finally makes it back to the tree branch where he first saw the golden-brown thing.
There he tells his friends and family about his adventure.

The next day while he is sitting on a his tree branch, he sees something curly and brown.
