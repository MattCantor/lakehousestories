# Wally the Wolf Runs For Mayor

There is going to be an election in the town where the lakehouse is!
The town needs a new mayor.
Everyone is very excited and talking about the election.
Wally the wolf and Mr. Finnigan are going to run for mayor.

Mr. Finnigan and is responsible and well-respected member of the community. He would make a great mayor.
Wally is an untrustworthy and dishonest predator.
Everyone knows that Wally should not be the mayor. But, he's is /very/ well liked and very clever.
               
Wally decides to cheat.
Wally goes to Mr. Finnigan's backyard, where they keep the chickens.  He tells the chickens his plan.
The chickens are terrified of Wally.
He has eaten many of the their friends and family, and they know he'll eat them to.  So they listen to what he has to say.
                
Wally tells the chickens his idea.  They will all go to vote at the upcoming election.
Since no one can tell them apart, they will continue to vote at the upcoming election, as many times as they can.
And of course, they will cast these votes for Wally.  Or else!

The chickens do as they are told.
On election day, the voter turnout for the mayoral election is huge! (most of the votes are by chickens).
Wally wins by a slim margin.
Wally is the new mayor!

Mr. Finnigan is suspicious, because it's obvious that eveyone knows that he would make an excellent mayor.
Wally is already focused on his first grift.
